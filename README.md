# BlackOut

This is a Mixed Reality game.
A physical card game that uses Augmented Reality (AR) to alter gameplay
- Using phones, players see virtual objects projected onto the cards


Players compete to turn all cards the same color.

The Catch:
- Players can only see the colors through their phones
- Every player sees a different combination of colors
- Special cards trigger unique abilities
